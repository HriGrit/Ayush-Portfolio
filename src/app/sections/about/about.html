  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    I'm an Associate Software Engineer specializing in TypeScript, Angular, and high performance web platforms. I design accessible, component driven UIs and resilient backends, emphasizing security, observability, and measurable business impact.
  </p>
  <p>
    Recent work spans enterprise MEAN applications with JWT based authentication and authorization, an AI assisted RAG pipeline on FastAPI with tool calling, and scalable, serverless messaging using Firebase and Redux. I care deeply about performance, reliability, and user experience (WCAG aligned interfaces).
  </p>
  <p>
    I collaborate effectively in cross functional teams, use Git based workflows for quality and speed, and ship features that are maintainable, secure, and cloud ready. When not building, I refine developer experience typed APIs, predictable state with signals, and clear CI practices.
